# STARTING OFF IN A RUST

You need to make a folder/directory in which all your projects will be kept as sub-folders. To make a directory named Projects:

FOR WINDOWS IN CMD:

> mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
> mkdir hello_world
> cd hello_world

## WRITING AND RUNNING A FIRST PROGRAM

Next, make a new source file and call it main.rs (in src) Rust files always end with the .rs extension. If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, use an underscore to separate them.For example First_program

Now open your main.rs and write your first program and save it.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("HELLO WORLD");
}
```

*Congratulation* You have written yopurfirst program.now yopu have to run it,

write **cargo run** in your vsc code terminal

```rust
HELLO WORLD
```
